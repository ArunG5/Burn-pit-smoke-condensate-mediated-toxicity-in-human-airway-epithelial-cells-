# Biomarker Friedman Analysis
- Testing for statistical differences across burn conditions (control, smoldering, and flaming) for each individual biomarker (mRNAs or cytokines) within low (1ug/mL) and high (25ug/mL) concentrations after a 24 hour exposure
- Used a Friedman's test (non-parametric test for 3+ group comparisons) followed by Nemenyi's post hoc tests
